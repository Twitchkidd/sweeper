/*
 * So the way I picture it, there's a title and description at the top of a
 * centered stack, and it's right aligned in the sketch, then ... it really
 * makes sense for that to be it's own line, maybe ... so a prompt 'Name:' and
 * an input and submit button, and then two columns below that, one with a
 * heading of 'Top Scores:' and then for each difficulty the player and their
 * time, and then on the other side buttons for each difficulty, and then a
 * footer at the bottom, link to code, etc. Then when a name has been entered,
 * where the prompt was would be one of those blank profile pic type things and
 * the player's name, and ... somewhere, either next to the top times or next
 * to the buttons, the player's times, or n/a, and then I realized I forgot
 * changing player name, one step at a time here, if I can get all that onto
 * the page we're doin' okay.
