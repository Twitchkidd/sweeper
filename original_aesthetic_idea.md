# original aesthetic idea!

Like an old computer with the dark screen and the orange, and it did it's best to make sort of a 3d effect with a lofi grid following perspective and different brightnesses of orange, and that was kinda it, except the numbers should be colored, so we've got that already, but that was going to be the vibe, and then the grid of squares, it needed to be colored carefully to not look like the background, that was sorta it though, more of an 80s vibe dark mode minesweeper. Go!
